Hands-on #1: From the results of the previous tutorial, 
create a new simulation called "appearance.wbt" by using 
the File / Save World As... menu.

Hands-on #2: In the Shape node representing graphically the first wall, add a PBRAppearance node to the appearance field.

Set its baseColor field to blue using the color selector.
Set its metalness field to 0 using the field editor.
Finally, set its roughness field to 0.5 using the field editor.
If the DEF-USE mechanism of the previous tutorial has been correctly implemented, all the walls should turn blue.

Hands-on #3: Add a pre-defined PBRAppearance

Select the appearance field and remove the previously added node. 
To do this, either press the "delete" button on your keyboard or 
right-click on the field and select "delete" from the menu. The field 
should now say "appearance NULL" instead of "appearance PBRAppearance".
Double-click on the field again, then navigate to PROTO nodes (Webots Projects), 
then appearances and select OldSteel (PBRAppearance).

Hands-on #4: add a locally available texture to the ball.

Download the texture available here and save it to your disk.
Remove the previously added node from the appearance field and add a PBRAppearance node instead.
Add an ImageTexture node to the baseColorMap field of the PBRAppearance node.
Add an item to the ImageTexture's url field using the Add button.
Then set the value of the newly added url item using the "Select" button.
Follow the path to the location where you saved the texture and select it.

Hands-on #5: View the simulation in wireframe mode by using the View / 
Wireframe Rendering menu item. Then restore the plain rendering mode: View / Plain Rendering.
