Hands on #2: At the end of the scene tree, add a Robot node having four 
HingeJoint nodes having a Solid node as endPoint. Please refer to this figure. 
Add a Shape node containing a Box geometry to the Robot node. 
Set the color of the Shape to red. Use the Shape to define the boundingObject field of the Robot node. 
The dimension of the box is (0.2, 0.1, 0.05). Add a Physics node to the Robot. 
The figure represents all the nodes defining the robot. So far, only the direct children nodes 
of the root Robot node has been implemented.

HingeJoint
The initial position of the wheel is defined by the translation and the rotation fields of the Solid node.

The rotation origin (anchor) and the rotation axis (axis) are defined by the optional HingeJointParameters 
child of the HingeJoint node.

The radius of the wheel is 0.04 and its thickness (height of the cylinder) is 0.02. 
For the first wheel, the Solid translation should be defined to (0.05, 0.06, 0) in 
order to define the relative gap between the body and the wheel, and the rotation to 
(1 0 0 1.5708) for the wheel cylinder to be correctly oriented. 
The HingeJointParameters anchor should also be defined to (0.05, 0.06, 0) to define the 
rotation origin (relatively to the body). Finally, the HingeJointParameters axis should 
define the rotation axis. In our case it's along the y-axis (so (0, 1, 0)).

Hands on #3: Add a HingeJointParameters node, and enter the field values as described above. 
Some signs obviously have to be updated for other wheels.

Now, let's implement the cylinder shape of the wheels.

For each HingeJoint, there are three fields in which nodes need to be added.

jointParameters: Add a HingeJointParameters and configure the anchor (0.05 -0.06 0) and axis (0 1 0) fields.
These values have to be modified according to the location of the wheel.
device: Add a RotationalMotor in order to be able to actuate the wheels. 
Change their name fields from wheel1 to wheel4 according to this figure. 
These labels will be used to reference the wheels from the controller.
endPoint: Add a Solid node, then a Shape node in the children field of the Solid, 
and finally, add a Cylinder in the geometry field of the Shape node. 
The Cylinder should have a radius of 0.04 and a height of 0.02. Set the color of the wheels to green.

Hands on #4: Complete the missing nodes to get the same structure as the one depicted in this figure.
Don't forget the Physics nodes.

Sensors
The sensors used on the e-puck of Tutorial 4 are not the same as the ones used in this section. 
Pay attention to their measuring interval which is between 0 cm = 0 and 10 cm = 1000. 
Find more information about the lookupTable field here.

The last part of the robot modeling is to add the two distance sensors to the robot. 
This can be done by adding two DistanceSensor nodes as direct children of the Robot node. 
Note that the distance sensor acquires its data along the positive x-axis. So, 
it is necessary to rotate the distance sensor to point their x-axis outside the robot (see the figure).

Hands on #5: Add the two distance sensors as explained above. 
The distance sensors are at an angle to 0.3 [rad] with the front vector of the robot. 
Set the graphical and physical shape to a cube (not transformed) having a edge of 0.01 [m]. 
Set the color to blue. Set the name field according to the labels of this figure.

Hands on #6: Implement a controller called four_wheeled_collision_avoidance moving the robot 
and avoiding obstacles by detecting them by the distance sensors.

*Controller Code*

from controller import Robot

# Set the basic time step (used for sensor refresh rate and simulation step)
TIME_STEP = 64

# Create a Robot instance to interact with the simulation
robot = Robot()

# Initialize distance sensors
ds = []
dsNames = ['ds_right', 'ds_left']  # Names of the distance sensors

# Get and enable distance sensors
for i in range(2):
    ds.append(robot.getDevice(dsNames[i]))  # Get sensor by name
    ds[i].enable(TIME_STEP)  # Enable sensor with the defined time step

# Initialize wheels
wheels = []
wheelsNames = ['wheel1', 'wheel2', 'wheel3', 'wheel4']  # Names of the wheels

# Get wheel motors, set them to velocity control mode
for i in range(4):
    wheels.append(robot.getDevice(wheelsNames[i]))  # Get wheel motor by name
    wheels[i].setPosition(float('inf'))  # Allow infinite rotation (velocity control)
    wheels[i].setVelocity(0.0)  # Initialize with zero velocity

# Obstacle avoidance counter (used to determine how long to avoid an obstacle)
avoidObstacleCounter = 0

# Main loop: continue as long as the simulation is running
while robot.step(TIME_STEP) != -1:
    # Default forward speed for both sides
    leftSpeed = 7.0
    rightSpeed = 7.0

    # If avoiding obstacle, spin in place
    if avoidObstacleCounter > 0:
        avoidObstacleCounter -= 1  # Decrease counter each step
        leftSpeed = 1.5
        rightSpeed = -1.5  # Rotate in place
    else:
        # Check sensor values
        for i in range(2):
            if ds[i].getValue() < 950.0:  # If obstacle detected
                avoidObstacleCounter = 100  # Trigger avoidance behavior

    # Set wheel speeds
    wheels[0].setVelocity(leftSpeed)
    wheels[1].setVelocity(rightSpeed)
    wheels[2].setVelocity(leftSpeed)
    wheels[3].setVelocity(rightSpeed)
