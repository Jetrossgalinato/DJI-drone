Hands on #2: At the end of the scene tree, add a Robot node having four 
HingeJoint nodes having a Solid node as endPoint. Please refer to this figure. 
Add a Shape node containing a Box geometry to the Robot node. 
Set the color of the Shape to red. Use the Shape to define the boundingObject field of the Robot node. 
The dimension of the box is (0.2, 0.1, 0.05). Add a Physics node to the Robot. 
The figure represents all the nodes defining the robot. So far, only the direct children nodes 
of the root Robot node has been implemented.

HingeJoint
The initial position of the wheel is defined by the translation and the rotation fields of the Solid node.

The rotation origin (anchor) and the rotation axis (axis) are defined by the optional HingeJointParameters 
child of the HingeJoint node.

The radius of the wheel is 0.04 and its thickness (height of the cylinder) is 0.02. 
For the first wheel, the Solid translation should be defined to (0.05, 0.06, 0) in 
order to define the relative gap between the body and the wheel, and the rotation to 
(1 0 0 1.5708) for the wheel cylinder to be correctly oriented. 
The HingeJointParameters anchor should also be defined to (0.05, 0.06, 0) to define the 
rotation origin (relatively to the body). Finally, the HingeJointParameters axis should 
define the rotation axis. In our case it's along the y-axis (so (0, 1, 0)).

Hands on #3: Add a HingeJointParameters node, and enter the field values as described above. 
Some signs obviously have to be updated for other wheels.

Hands on #4: Complete the missing nodes to get the same structure as the one depicted in this figure.
Don't forget the Physics nodes.
