Hands on #2: At the end of the scene tree, add a Robot node having four 
HingeJoint nodes having a Solid node as endPoint. Please refer to this figure. 
Add a Shape node containing a Box geometry to the Robot node. 
Set the color of the Shape to red. Use the Shape to define the boundingObject field of the Robot node. 
The dimension of the box is (0.2, 0.1, 0.05). Add a Physics node to the Robot. 
The figure represents all the nodes defining the robot. So far, only the direct children nodes 
of the root Robot node has been implemented.

Hands on #3: Add a HingeJointParameters node, and enter the field values as described above. 
Some signs obviously have to be updated for other wheels.
