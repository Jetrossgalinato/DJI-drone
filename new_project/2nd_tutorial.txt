Hands-on #1: Make sure the my_first_simulation.wbt world file is open, 
and that the simulation is paused and is at a virtual time of 0. Using the File / Save World As... menu, 
save the simulation as obstacles.wbt.

--Modifying the Floor

The default RectangleArena PROTO defines a simple floor pinned on the static environment, 
i.e. without Physics node, and surrounded by walls. 
Other pre-built floors are available in the Webots objects library. 
We will now delete the RectangleArena node and add a simple floor that we will manually 
surround with walls later in this tutorial.

Hands-on #2: To remove the RectangleArena, 
select it either in the 3D view or in the scene tree view with a left click and press the del key on your keyboard. 
Alternatively, you can right click on it in the 3D view and select Delete in the context menu 
(you can also use the context menu directly in the scene tree view). 
Select the TexturedBackgroundLight node and click on the Add button. 
In the open dialog box, and choose PROTO nodes (Webots Projects) / objects / floors / Floor (Solid).

Hands-on #3: In the scene tree view select and expand the Floor. 
Modify the size field and set it to {1, 1} to resize it to 1mx1m.
