Hands on #1:
Pause the current simulation by clicking on the Pause button  of the 3D view 
(see the user interface description to find out the buttons). 
The simulation is paused if the virtual time counter on the main toolbar is stopped. 
Create a new project from the File / New / New Project Directory... menu item and follow the instructions:

Name the project directory my_first_simulation instead of the proposed my_project.
Name the world file my_first_simulation.wbt instead of the proposed empty.wbt.
Click all the tick boxes, including the "Add a rectangle arena" which is not ticked by default

Hands-on #2: Double-click on the RectangleArena node in the scene tree. This should open the node and display its fields.

Select the floorTileSize field and set its value to 0.25 0.25 instead of 0.5 0.5. 
You should see the effect immediately in the 3D view.
Select the wallHeight field and change its value to 0.05 instead of 0.1. The wall of the arena should now be lower.
